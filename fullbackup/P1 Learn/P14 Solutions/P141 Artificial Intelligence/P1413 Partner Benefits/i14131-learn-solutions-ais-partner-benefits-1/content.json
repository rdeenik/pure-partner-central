    "body" : "<h2>Multi-dimensional performance at scale</h2><div>AI workloads generate diverse I/O profiles, making a consistent, multi-dimensional storage infrastructure vital for scalable, consolidated data and performance. Pure’s “AND, not OR” approach combines scale-out solutions for scalability with scale-up architectures needed for low-latency, transactional workloads like vector databases. Unified FlashArray™ and FlashBlade® consolidate block, file, and object storage for high scalability and performance. DirectFlash® technology removes SSD inefficiencies, centralizing IO path management for peak performance, while DirectFlash Modules (DFMs) offer high density (150TB today, 300TB soon) with top-tier resiliency (&lt;0.2% annual return rate) and zero downtime.</div>",
