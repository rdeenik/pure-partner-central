That  allows customers nearly unlimited numbers of snapshots at a frequency optimized for their own operations.  SafeMode is designed to balance protection and capacity utilization. By leveraging Pure1 Meta’s capacity planning capabilities, users can model the impact of regular snapshots and retention policies against their array’s live capacity data. This ensures that SafeMode can be implemented without significant additional costs.</div>",
